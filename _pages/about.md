<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

Greetings! 

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Langauge Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Shinji Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/view/shinjiwatanabe). Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science at Peking University (2023) and B.S. in Electronic Information Engineerining at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (2020). Here is my CV.

I am broadly interested in applied speech processing research, such as speech recognition, enhancement and synthesis, mainly with machine learning approaches.

Feel free to contact me for any discussion!
